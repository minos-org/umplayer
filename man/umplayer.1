.IP
The rest of options (if any) will be ignored and the application will exit. It will return 0
on success or \-1 on failure.
.TP
.B \-actions <action_list>
<action_list> is a list of actions separated by spaces. The
actions will be executed just after loading the file (if
any) in the same order as input. For switchable actions
you can pass true or false as parameter.

Quotes are necessary in case you pass more than one action.

finishes.

Do not close the main window when the file/playlist
finishes.

Play the video in fullscreen mode.
.TP

.TP
.B -add\-to\-playlist
If there is another instance running, the media will be
added to that instance's playlist. If there is no other
instance, this option will be ignored and the files will be
opened in a new instance.
.TP
.B <media1> <media2> ...
Any kind of file that UMPlayer can open. It can be a local file,
a DVD (e.g. dvd://1), an Internet stream
(e.g. mms://....) or a local playlist in format m3u or pls. If the
\fB\-playlist\fR option is used, that means that UMPlayer will
pass the \fB\-playlist\fR option to MPlayer, so MPlayer will
handle the playlist, not UMPlayer.
